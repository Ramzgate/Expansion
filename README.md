# Expansion Coefficients 
In this section we continuously estimate the network expansion coefficiant 

The expansion of a graph is a measure of how well-connected or well-expanded the graph is. It quantifies how easily one can reach a large portion of the vertices in the graph from a given subset of vertices. A graph with good expansion properties has a large number of edges between a subset of vertices and the rest of the graph, ensuring efficient communication and spreading of information.

Formally, the expansion of a graph is defined as the minimum "edge expansion" over all non-empty subsets of vertices. The edge expansion of a subset S of vertices is the ratio of the number of edges that have one endpoint in S and the other in the complement of S to the minimum of the sizes of S and its complement. In other words, it measures how well-connected S is to the rest of the graph.

A graph with high expansion has good connectivity properties, and it is particularly useful in applications involving network communication, random walks, and error-correcting codes. Expander graphs are examples of graphs with strong expansion properties and are widely studied in various areas of computer science, mathematics, and network theory.
